# 🚀 Quick Start: Add Deep Linking to Your Landing Page

## What This Does

Transforms your existing beautiful landing page into a deep linking hub that:
- ✅ Opens shared profiles, posts, and streams in your app
- ✅ Works with iOS Universal Links and Android App Links
- ✅ Falls back gracefully for users without the app
- ✅ Keeps all your existing design and functionality

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Vercel account and project set up
- ✅ Domain ltrd.space configured
- ✅ iOS Team ID: `SV329B54UF` (already configured)

## 🎯 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/deandretaylor/Desktop/Lettered/landing-page
./setup-deep-linking.sh
```

This automatically:
- Creates `.well-known/` directory
- Copies association files
- Sets up proper structure

### Step 2: Add Deep Link Handler to index.html (1 minute)

Open `index.html` and add this line **before the closing `</body>` tag** (around line 959):

```html
    <!-- Deep Link Handler -->
    <script src="deep-link-handler.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

That's it! The handler is already created and ready to use.

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (1 minute)

```bash
# Make sure you're in the landing-page directory
cd /Users/deandretaylor/Desktop/Lettered/landing-page

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

When prompted:
- Link to existing project: **Yes**
- Select your ltrd.space project
- Deploy

## ✅ Verify Setup

### Test 1: Association Files

```bash
# iOS file
curl https://ltrd.space/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

# Should return JSON with Team ID: SV329B54UF

# Android file
curl https://ltrd.space/.well-known/assetlinks.json

# Should return JSON (even if placeholder)
```

### Test 2: Root Page

Visit: `https://ltrd.space/`

- ✅ Your landing page loads normally
- ✅ All features work as before

### Test 3: Deep Links

On your phone, open these URLs in Safari/Chrome:

```
https://ltrd.space/profile/test123
https://ltrd.space/post/test456
https://ltrd.space/stream/test789
```

Expected behavior:
1. ✅ Page attempts to open app automatically
2. ✅ Modal appears with "Open in App" button
3. ✅ Shows download buttons if app not installed
4. ✅ Your landing page design is maintained

## 📁 What Gets Added

```
landing-page/
├── .well-known/
│   ├── apple-app-site-association   ← iOS Universal Links
│   └── assetlinks.json               ← Android App Links  
├── deep-link-handler.js              ← Deep link detection (NEW)
├── vercel.json                       ← Routing config (NEW)
├── setup-deep-linking.sh             ← Setup script (NEW)
└── index.html                        ← Add one <script> tag
```

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **Normal Visitors** → See your landing page as usual
2. **Deep Link Visitors** → JavaScript detects the path (`/profile/123`)
3. **App Installed** → Automatically attempts to open app
4. **No App** → Shows modal with download buttons
5. **Association Files** → Enable Universal/App Links for seamless opening

## 🔧 Customization

### Update App Store URLs

Edit `deep-link-handler.js` (around line 12):

```javascript
appStoreUrls: {
    ios: 'https://apps.apple.com/app/lettered/idYOUR_REAL_ID',
    android: 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lettered.app'
}
```

### Change Modal Appearance

Edit `deep-link-handler.js` - Look for `showDeepLinkModal()` function to customize colors, text, or layout.

### Add Analytics

Add tracking to the `openApp()` function:

```javascript
function openApp(deepLink) {
    // Add your analytics here
    gtag('event', 'deep_link_clicked', {
        type: deepLink.type,
        id: deepLink.id
    });
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Deep link modal doesn't appear

**Check:**
- Script is added to index.html: `<script src="deep-link-handler.js"></script>`
- Script loads without errors (check browser console)
- URL matches pattern: `/profile/id`, `/post/id`, or `/stream/id`

### Association files return 404

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify files exist
ls -la .well-known/

# If missing, run setup again
./setup-deep-linking.sh

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### App doesn't open automatically

**Likely causes:**
- iOS: App not rebuilt yet (see `DEEP_LINKING_READY_FOR_IOS.md`)
- Android: SHA256 not set up yet (see TODO in AndroidManifest.xml)
- Custom scheme still works: `lettered://profile/123`

## 📱 App Integration

Your app is already configured! Just need to rebuild:

### iOS
```bash
cd /Users/deandretaylor/Desktop/Lettered/lettered-app
npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
npx expo run:ios
```

See: `DEEP_LINKING_READY_FOR_IOS.md` for testing instructions

### Android (Later)
See TODO in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
