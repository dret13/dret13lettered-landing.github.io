# Debug Google Integration - Step by Step

You received the email but data isn't appearing in Sheets/Drive. Let's fix this!

## üîç The Error

```
Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 8
```

This means your `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS` in Vercel has formatting issues.

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix (10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Your JSON Credentials Locally

**Test your credentials work:**

1. Create a file called `.env` in the `landing-page` folder (if you don't have one)

2. Open your service account JSON file from Google Cloud

3. Copy the **ENTIRE content** and minify it using: https://codebeautify.org/jsonminifier

4. Add to your `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"...",...}
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-sheet-id
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your-folder-id
```

**Important**: Make sure there are NO line breaks in the JSON!

5. Test locally:
```bash
cd /Users/deandretaylor/Desktop/Lettered/landing-page
npm run dev
```

6. Submit a test form at http://localhost:3000

If it works locally, the issue is in Vercel environment variables!

### Step 2: Check Your Google Sheet Name

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Look at the **tab name** at the bottom
3. Is it exactly **"Sheet1"**?

**If NOT "Sheet1"**:
- Either rename the tab to "Sheet1"
- OR update the code (see below)

**To update code for different sheet name:**

Open `api/verification-submit.js` and find line 163:
```javascript
range: 'Sheet1!A:Q', // Change 'Sheet1' to your actual sheet name
```

Change `Sheet1` to whatever your tab is called (e.g., `Submissions`, `Data`, etc.)

### Step 3: Fix Vercel Environment Variables

This is the most common issue!

#### Option A: Copy from Local (Easiest)

1. Open your `.env` file
2. Copy the ENTIRE value after `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS=`
3. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Edit `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS`
5. **DELETE everything** in the value field
6. Paste the value from your `.env`
7. Save

#### Option B: Minify and Upload Fresh

1. Open your JSON file in text editor
2. Go to: https://codebeautify.org/jsonminifier
3. Paste JSON content
4. Click "Minify"
5. Copy the minified result
6. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Environment Variables
7. Edit `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS`
8. Paste minified JSON
9. Save

### Step 4: Verify All Environment Variables

Check that ALL of these are set in Vercel:

‚úÖ `SMTP_HOST`
‚úÖ `SMTP_PORT`
‚úÖ `SMTP_USER`
‚úÖ `SMTP_PASS`
‚úÖ `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`
‚úÖ `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
‚úÖ `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS` (minified, one line!)
‚úÖ `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`

### Step 5: Redeploy

```bash
cd /Users/deandretaylor/Desktop/Lettered/landing-page
vercel --prod
```

### Step 6: Test Again

Submit a new test form and check:
1. ‚úÖ Email received?
2. ‚úÖ Data in Google Sheet?
3. ‚úÖ Image in Google Drive?

## üîç Additional Checks

### Check 1: Sheet Permissions

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click "Share" button
3. Verify your service account email is listed

### Check 2: Drive Folder Permissions

1. Open Google Drive folder
2. Right-click ‚Üí Share
3. Verify service account email is listed
4. Should have "Editor" access

### Check 3: APIs Enabled

Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

1. Select your project
2. APIs & Services ‚Üí Enabled APIs
3. Verify BOTH are enabled:
   - ‚úÖ Google Sheets API
   - ‚úÖ Google Drive API

If not, enable them!

### Check 4: Sheet ID is Correct

                                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                                            This is the ID
```

Copy JUST the ID part (not the full URL)

## üß™ Test Script

I've created `test-json.js` for you. Use it to validate your credentials:

```bash
# Edit test-json.js and paste your minified JSON
node test-json.js
```

Should output:
```
‚úÖ JSON is VALID!
Service Account Email: your-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Project ID: your-project-id
```

If you get an error, your JSON needs fixing!

## üéØ After Fixing, Test This Way

### Test 1: Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Go to http://localhost:3000
# Submit form
# Check console for logs
```

### Test 2: Check Vercel Logs

After deployment, go to:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Deployments ‚Üí Click latest deployment
3. Functions ‚Üí Click `/api/verification-submit`
4. View logs

**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ "Successfully wrote to Google Sheets"

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Double-Check This Exact Sequence:

1. ‚úÖ Service account created in Google Cloud
2. ‚úÖ Service account JSON key downloaded
3. ‚úÖ JSON minified to ONE LINE
4. ‚úÖ Google Sheets API enabled
5. ‚úÖ Google Drive API enabled
6. ‚úÖ Sheet shared with service account email
7. ‚úÖ Drive folder shared with service account email
8. ‚úÖ Sheet tab named "Sheet1" (or code updated)
9. ‚úÖ All environment variables in Vercel
10. ‚úÖ Redeployed after adding variables

### Get the Service Account Email:

1. Open your JSON file
2. Find this line:
```json
"client_email": "something@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```
3. Copy that email
4. Verify it's shared on BOTH Sheet and Drive folder

### Verify Environment Variables Format:

In Vercel, environment variables should look EXACTLY like this:

**GOOGLE_SHEET_ID**:
```
1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p
```
(Just the ID, no URL)

**GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID**:
```
1x2y3z4a5b6c7d8e9f0g1h2i3j4k5l
```
(Just the ID, no URL)

**GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS**:
```
{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project","private_key_id":"abc123","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIB...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/name%40project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
```
(ONE continuous line, no breaks!)
