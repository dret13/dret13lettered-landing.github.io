# Image Storage System - Complete Overview

## 📸 How Images Are Handled

When a user uploads a pari image through the verification form, here's what happens:

```
User uploads image
    ↓
Frontend (index.html)
    - Converts image to Base64
    - Includes in form data
    ↓
API Endpoint (verification-submit.js)
    ↓
    ├─→ Email Attachment
    │   - Image sent to your email
    │   - Can view/download from email
    │
    ├─→ Google Drive Upload
    │   - Image uploaded to Drive folder
    │   - Unique filename generated
    │   - Returns shareable link
    │
    └─→ Google Sheets Entry
        - Stores Drive link in column O
        - Click link to view image
```
