## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Add Image Previews in Sheet

Instead of just links, show thumbnails:

1. In Google Sheet, add column R: "Preview"
2. In cell R2, add formula:
```
=IF(O2="No Image","",IMAGE(SUBSTITUTE(O2,"upload/","upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill/")))
```
3. Drag formula down
4. Now you see 100x100 previews! 🖼️

### Tip 2: Organize by Month

Images auto-organize in Cloudinary by folder:
```
lettered_verifications/
├── All images stored here
└── Searchable by date, tag, email
```

### Tip 3: Set Up Webhooks

Get notified when images are uploaded:
1. Cloudinary Dashboard → Settings
2. Upload → Notification URL
3. Add your webhook endpoint

### Tip 4: Auto-Delete Old Images

Cloudinary can auto-delete images after X days:
```javascript
// Add to upload options
expires_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (90 * 24 * 60 * 60) // 90 days
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading?

**Check:**
1. All 3 Cloudinary variables in Vercel?
2. Credentials correct (from Cloudinary dashboard)?
3. Check Vercel logs for errors

### Invalid credentials error?

- Re-copy credentials from Cloudinary dashboard
- Make sure no spaces before/after values
- Verify API secret is the full string

### Quota exceeded?

- Check usage: Cloudinary Dashboard → Analytics
- Free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month
- Upgrade if needed (plans start at $99/month for more)

---

## 📈 Monitor Usage

### Check Storage Used:
1. Cloudinary Dashboard
2. Top right → Shows storage used / total
3. Example: "2.5 GB / 25 GB"

### Check Bandwidth:
1. Dashboard → Analytics
2. See monthly bandwidth usage
3. Free tier: 25GB/month (resets monthly)

### Estimate Capacity:
```
Average image: 2 MB
25 GB = 25,000 MB
Capacity: ~12,500 images

At 10 images/day:
Full in: ~3.5 years
```
