# Fixes Applied - Form Integration Issues Resolved

## 🔍 Issues Found

### Issue #1: Google Sheets Range Error
```
Error: Unable to parse range: Sheet1!A:Q
```

**Cause**: Your Google Sheet tab wasn't named "Sheet1"

**Fix**: Code now auto-detects the actual sheet tab name

### Issue #2: Google Drive Service Account Error
```
Error: Service Accounts do not have storage quota
```

**Cause**: Personal Google Drive doesn't work with service accounts (needs Google Workspace Shared Drive - paid only)

**Fix**: Switched to **Cloudinary** (free, 25GB storage, works perfectly!)

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Google Sheets - Auto-Detect Sheet Name**

**Before:**
```javascript
range: 'Sheet1!A:Q' // Failed if tab wasn't named "Sheet1"
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Auto-detects your actual sheet tab name
const metadata = await sheets.spreadsheets.get({ spreadsheetId });
sheetName = metadata.data.sheets[0].properties.title;
range: `${sheetName}!A:Q` // Works with any tab name!
```

### 2. **Image Storage - Switched to Cloudinary**

**Before:**
```javascript
uploadToGoogleDrive() // ❌ Failed - service accounts can't use personal Drive
```

**After:**
```javascript
uploadToCloudinary() // ✅ Works perfectly - 25GB free storage
```

### 3. **Dependencies Updated**

Added:
```json
"cloudinary": "^2.5.1"
```
